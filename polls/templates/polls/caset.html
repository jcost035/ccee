                I can definitely say that has carried so much to [my college life in New York]...
                New York is so different from Porterville, California. There's a lot of new things
                to discover and a lot of new choices I have to make. What's really helped me
                take the stress off of it, is going back to Mrs. Drum's calm, sunshine voice and
                going through the lesson, through your choices, options, how to analyze and
                interpret, and decide what's best for you.

                I can definitely say that it's taken a lot of pressure and anxiety and stress off
                of all the choices that come with adulting, college, and being 3,000 miles away
                from your family."
